  - [ ] Only VRF Coordinator can call fulfillRandomWords
  - [ ] Only FlipBattle can fund prize pool

### Reentrancy Protection

- [ ] **All state-changing functions protected**
  - [ ] FlipBattle.createFlip - ‚úÖ nonReentrant
  - [ ] FlipBattle.acceptFlip - ‚úÖ nonReentrant
  - [ ] FlipBattle.cancelFlip - ‚úÖ nonReentrant
  - [ ] FlipBattle.claimWinnings - ‚úÖ nonReentrant

  - [ ] ReferralSystem.claimEarnings - ‚úÖ nonReentrant
  - [ ] DailyFreeFlip.enterDailyFlip - ‚úÖ nonReentrant
  - [ ] DailyFreeFlip.claimWinnings - ‚úÖ nonReentrant

- [ ] **State updates before external calls**
  - [ ] All state changes happen before USDC transfers
  - [ ] No state changes after external calls
  - [ ] Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern followed

### Integer Overflow/Underflow

- [ ] **Solidity 0.8.28 used** (built-in overflow protection) ‚úÖ
- [ ] **No unchecked blocks** without justification
- [ ] **Arithmetic operations safe**
  - [ ] Percentage calculations (5%, 95%, etc.) cannot overflow
  - [ ] Bet amounts validated against max uint256
  - [ ] Reward calculations safe

### Input Validation

- [ ] **FlipBattle.sol**
  - [ ] Bet amount >= minimumBet (1 USDC)
  - [ ] Opponent address != address(0)
  - [ ] Opponent address != msg.sender
  - [ ] Game exists before operations
  - [ ] Game in correct state for operation

- [ ] **StreakManager.sol**
  - [ ] User cannot check in twice same day
  - [ ] Reward day is valid milestone (7, 14, 30, 60, 90)
  - [ ] Reward not already claimed

- [ ] **ReferralSystem.sol**
  - [ ] Referrer address != address(0)
  - [ ] Referrer address != msg.sender
  - [ ] User not already registered
  - [ ] Bet amount > 0

- [ ] **DailyFreeFlip.sol**
  - [ ] User can only play once per 24 hours
  - [ ] Contract is active
  - [ ] Game exists before claiming

### External Calls

- [ ] **USDC transfers**
  - [ ] Always check return value (or use SafeERC20)
  - [ ] Handle failed transfers gracefully
  - [ ] No USDC sent to address(0)

- [ ] **VRF requests**
  - [ ] Only callable by contracts
  - [ ] Request IDs properly tracked
  - [ ] Subscription has sufficient LINK
  - [ ] Consumer added to subscription

### State Management

- [ ] **Game states (FlipBattle)**
  - [ ] State transitions valid (Pending ‚Üí Active ‚Üí Completed)
  - [ ] No way to skip states
  - [ ] Cancelled games cannot be accepted
  - [ ] Completed games cannot be modified

- [ ] **Time-based logic**
  - [ ] Streak calculations use block.timestamp
  - [ ] 24-hour checks are accurate
  - [ ] Expiration logic correct (24 hours)
  - [ ] No timestamp manipulation possible

- [ ] **Balance tracking**
  - [ ] All USDC movements tracked
  - [ ] Platform fees accumulated correctly
  - [ ] Reward pools updated accurately
  - [ ] No loss of funds in calculations

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Common Vulnerabilities

### Reentrancy

- [ ] No reentrancy possible in any function
- [ ] ReentrancyGuard from OpenZeppelin used
- [ ] State updated before external calls
- [ ] No delegate calls to untrusted contracts

### Front-Running

- [ ] **Potential risks identified**:
  - [ ] User A creates flip, User B frontruns to accept
  - [ ] Mitigation: Users specify opponent address (fixed)
  - [ ] Streak check-ins cannot be frontrun (user-specific)
  - [ ] VRF randomness cannot be predicted or manipulated

### Oracle Manipulation

- [ ] **Chainlink VRF used** (not manipulable) ‚úÖ
- [ ] No external price oracles (not needed)
- [ ] No off-chain data dependencies

### Denial of Service

- [ ] **No unbounded loops**
  - [ ] getUserFlips returns limited array
  - [ ] getReferrals returns limited array
  - [ ] No iteration over user-controlled data

- [ ] **Gas limits considered**
  - [ ] All functions complete within block gas limit
  - [ ] No operations that could run out of gas

### Integer Issues

- [ ] **Division before multiplication**
  - [ ] Platform fee: amount * platformFee / 100 (safe)
  - [ ] Referral percentage: amount * 5 / 100 (safe)

- [ ] **Rounding errors acceptable**
  - [ ] 5% of 1 USDC = 50000 (0.05 USDC) ‚úÖ
  - [ ] Minimum bet 1 USDC ensures no rounding to zero

### Access Control

- [ ] **onlyOwner functions**
  - [ ] Only non-critical operations
  - [ ] Cannot steal user funds
  - [ ] Cannot modify game outcomes
  - [ ] Owner can renounce ownership (if desired)

- [ ] **Function visibility**
  - [ ] Internal functions not public
  - [ ] Private data truly private
  - [ ] No unnecessary public functions

### Token Handling

- [ ] **USDC (ERC20)**
  - [ ] Approve pattern used correctly
  - [ ] TransferFrom checks return value
  - [ ] No approval race condition
  - [ ] Balance checks before transfers

- [ ] **No native ETH handling** (good - simpler)

  - [ ] Custom errors used (gas efficient)
  - [ ] Error messages clear and helpful

## üö® Known Issues & Limitations

### By Design

- [ ] **Contracts not upgradable**
  - Intentional for security/simplicity
  - Cannot fix bugs without redeployment
  - Users must trust immutable code

- [ ] **No emergency withdrawal**
  - Funds locked until games complete
  - Owner cannot rescue stuck funds
  - VRF failure could lock funds

- [ ] **No bet limits (except minimum)**
  - Users can bet large amounts
  - Whales could dominate
  - Consider adding maximum bet limit

### Potential Improvements

- [ ] **Consider adding**:
  - [ ] Maximum bet limit
  - [ ] Daily/weekly bet limits per user
  - [ ] Pause mechanism for emergencies
  - [ ] Timelock for owner functions
  - [ ] Multi-sig for owner role

- [ ] **VRF edge cases**:
  - [ ] What if VRF never fulfills?
  - [ ] What if LINK runs out?
  - [ ] Consider refund mechanism after timeout
