- Can verify manually later on BaseScan

### "VRF request not fulfilled"
- Check LINK balance in subscription
- Verify consumers added correctly
- Wait up to 2 minutes
- Check VRF dashboard for errors

### "Transaction reverted"
- Check USDC approval granted
- Verify sufficient USDC balance
- Check minimum bet (1 USDC)
