**One sentence pitch:**
A viral Farcaster mini app where users challenge each other to instant $1-$5 coin flip duels on Base network, generating massive transaction volume for airdrop farming.

**The magic:**
- 10-second games (challenge → flip → payout)

- Free engagement features (daily check-ins, streaks, referrals)
- Perfect for Base airdrop farming (micro-transactions at scale)

✅ **Referral loops:** Dropbox growth (4M → 100M users)

### Unique Advantages
